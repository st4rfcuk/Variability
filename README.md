"Curves" is a project created by @st4rfcuk based on 5 parameters : 
m0 : use it to change the color
m1 : use it to change vectors orientation
m2 : use it to change vectors orientation
m3 : use it to change vectors orientation
m4 : use it to change vectors orientation

The m1, m2, m3, m4 are implemented in the spiral equation which is : (y-y0-(x-x0),-(x-x0)-(y-y0)) that becomes (y*m1-y0*m1-(x*m2-x0*m2),-(x*m3-x0*m3)-(y*m4-y0*m4)). 

Based on the rules imposed by Editart.xyz, some parameters are fixed such as the numbers of colors (locked on 3).
